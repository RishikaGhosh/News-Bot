# About the Bot
## Features 📰
* This bot is trained to fetch news from any **country** and in **any language**.
* It is equipped for small talk.
* It is also equipped with a custom keyboard which will show you all the available topics.
* Also, the bot is trained for fuzzy matching i.e. it can identify the topics even if you mispell them. 
  - E.g.  If you mispell "sports" as "sprts","spots" etc, the bot can understand that you meant "sports".

## Inside the bot ⚒
It is a Python-Flask application, deployed using Heroku. 
Shortest way to explain my code:
* I trained the bot using **dialogflow**.
* Connected a service account from Google Cloud to the code.
* Added **gnewsclient** which helps the bot fetch news.
* Set up the webhook with Heroku.
